# AdvancedAlgorithmsProjects

All of these projects are written in Java

1) AVL Tree Project is a self balancing binary search tree

2) Breadth First Search project reads data from a txt file and creates a graph based on the data. It then performs a breadth first search on the entire graph and prints out which nodes it visits in order. There is no specific vertex being searched for, the program just traverses the entire graph in a breadth first search manner.

3) Sorting Algorithm Project implements insertion sort, various quicksort algorithms, and heapsort

4) Sudoku Project is able to solve sudoku puzzles. Most but not all sudoku puzzles are able to be solved by this program which was intentional and part of the assignment.
